        <textarea class="letter-area">Dear Kaitlyn,

I would love to spend Valentine's Day with you. To be transparent, I recently had to put 80% of my savings toward car maintenance, so I am currently on a tight budget. I still want to treat you to a nice time, but I was thinking of something more low-key, like relaxing at McArthur Park. We could grab some affordable snacks and just enjoy each other's company.

I apologize that I can't do more right now, but I would still love to take you out if you're open to it. However, If the weather ends up being bad, maybe we can just push it to another day when I can actually take you somewhere a bit special.I will keep you updated on which plan we should stick to based on the weather. 

Your Manliligaw,
Efren</textarea>
