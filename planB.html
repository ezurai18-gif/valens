        <textarea class="letter-area">Dear Kaitlyn,

If Plan A doesn't work out due to your schedule or the weather, I have a "Plan B" in mind. It might seem simple, but it would be special to me. I would love to just see you, even if only for a brief moment.

If you find yourself busy or if the weather is poor, just a short meeting would mean a lot to me. And I'd want to make it feel special for you too. Please let me know if this is something you would be open to.

Yours,
Efren</textarea>
